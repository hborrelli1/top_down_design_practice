What would be wrong withâ€¦

a class called Turing
- Turing is more of an instance of the class School than an object.

an attribute called current_time
- The current is always changing

having attributes for a Review class called one_star, two_stars, three_stars, etc.
- This would make more sense to be contained in one attribute such as 'numOfStars'.

a Senator class having an array attribute called senator_names
- A Senator class would not have multiple senator names within a single instance. The attribute could just be name.

a class called California
- There really would only be one California. California should be an object of the class State.

having attributes on a ShoppingCart class called item_one, item_two, item_three, etc.
- Instead of attributes on the class, they should be items within an array of the attribute items_in_cart

a method on GroceryStore called clean_aisle_seven
- This should be done by the method clean_up(7)

a Bottle class having an attribute called water
- the attribute should be content with 'water' as the string. It's possible to contain something other than water.

a Chair class having an attribute called number_of_chairs
- A class of Chair would not have children chairs.

a MenuItem class with a method called CustomerSurvey
- If there was a survey for a specific MenuItem, it would need to start with a lowercase customerSurvey
